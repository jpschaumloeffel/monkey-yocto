I. Adding the monkey layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the monkey layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the monkey layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the monkey layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-monkey \
    "
